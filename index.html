        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Tiana Herron and I am a current full time student at the University of California, Riverside. My current major is English, and I have not chosen an emphasis yet, but I am thinking about choosing an emphasis in fictional literature if I can. My end goal is to graduate at least one year early (I am about halfway through undergrad already) and then move on to get my teaching credential in single subject english for both high school and middle school english, literature, social studies classes. My favorite hobby of mine is, surprise-surprise, reading! I like to read fiction novels the most and sometimes nonfiction if I find it interesting enough. My favorite genres are fantasy fiction novels and science fiction novels as well. Maybe someday I will become an author on top of all of my other career goals. I would like to get my masterâ€™s degree, as I will then be the third generation in my family on my motherâ€™s side to be a teacher with a masterâ€™s degree. Most of my job and volunteer work experience is either with kids, animals, or both. When I was in middle school and high school I volunteered for my churchâ€™s nursery where I basically held, fed, read to, and played with babies the whole time. I did this for six years until I moved to Riverside to start college. My other volunteer work that I am currently doing is volunteering for my local cat rescue called CARMA where I am responsible for feeding the cats, changing their litter, brushing them, and giving them exercise by playing with them. I really enjoy this because I really love cats and it is very rewarding to see them being adopted and placed into their forever homes. My work experience includes lifeguarding and swim instructing, both of which required me to become CPR and AED certified. As a lifeguard I am responsible for watching over the patrons both in and out of the water and maintaining cleanliness on the pool deck. At some pools I also am in charge of checking the guests in as with covid reservation time slots have become popular in local homeowners association pools. My other job is being a swim instructor. I really enjoy this job because it is fun to play around with babies and kids in the water. I teach kids from four months old to about twelve years old. The swim instructing company that I work for is a chain called Australian swim school. It is an indoor swimming pool facility that is all shallow to prevent any serious drowning accidents. It is able to be open year round because the pool is indoors and is heated as well. Since most of my experience is with children I think that it is only fitting to go into a career teaching children my favorite hobby which is of course reading. I could not be more excited to begin my teaching journey when I graduate from UCR. <br><br>
